You can create an object to class as

class_name obj=new class_name();

java.lang is the default package, that comes automatically, no need to import them. 

All classes are derived from root class called java.lang.Object 

Control Structures : 
_____________________

Used to define the flow of the program. 

There are 2 types of control structures known as 

	(i) Branching 

	  if...else : Executes the statements based on the condition. 

		if(condition) {
		  statements;
	        } else {
	          statements;
	        }

       (ii) Looping 

	while loop : This loop executes all the statements repeatedly until the condition remains true, if the condition remains false, then it comes out of the loop. For every loop, basically there are 3 phases known as 

	(i) Initialization 

       (ii) Condition 

      (iii) Increment or Decrement 

Initialization performed at the beginning of the loop. 

Condition performed at the conditional part of the loop. 

Increment/Decrement performed before closing the loop. 

while(condition) {
 ...
 ...
}

for loop : Executes the statements repeatedly until the condition remains true, if condition remains false, then it comes out of the loop. 

for(initilization;condition;increment/decrement) {
   statements;
}


switch...case : Used to define menu-driven programs.
